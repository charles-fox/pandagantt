BSC-ROBOTMOTION,Robot motion control for a research platform with ROS,2019-10-01,2020-06-01,INTERNAL,"Mobile robotics research on new AI planning algorithms is dependent on a lower level technology stack include physical and simulated vehicles, motor controllers, and motion controllers. A motion controller takes as its input a short-term desired trajectory for the robot, such as a curved path over a few meters and a few seconds, and outputs desired wheel speeds over real time to implement this trajectory. This project implements a simulation and a motion controller for a real Lincoln research robot, for use in real Lincoln robotics research. It has two main parts. First, a simulation will be developed in Gazebo to accurately reproduce the physics of a real Lincoln robot, including simulation of its masses, motor controllers, and frictions. Second, the simulation will be used to port Lincolnâ€™s standard motion control stack (based on movebase with timed elastic bands) for use on the new robot. Once ported, the stack will be tested in simulation and optionally on the real robot. The final deliverable is the ability for a user to input a desired destination pose and have the system drive the robot to it from its start pose, for short distance trajectories with no obstacles.",,BSc,"David Churchill, Supervisor: Charles Fox"
