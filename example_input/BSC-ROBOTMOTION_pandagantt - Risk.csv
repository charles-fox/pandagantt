1,Physical robots,"The phyhsical robot might not be available if needed for active Lincoln research projects, or it may be broken or being upgraded.",MANAGEMENT,MITIGATE,The project is designed to promise only simulated results. It would be nice to demo on the real robot but this is strictly optional for delivery.,5,5,1,5,CHURCHILL
2,Software learning,"The project is based on real Lincoln research, it is not a greenfield project. As such there is a lot of existing code than needs to be understood before new development can begin. It will take time effort to get up to speed with the existing code base. This includes both open source ROS libraries such as movebase, and Lincoln's own simulation and control code as in the podcar github stack. There is a risk that a student will not be smart enough to get up to speed with all of this and still have time to make their own contribution.",TECHNICAL,MITIGATE,"The student is one of the top in the year group and has a proven track record of delivering advnaced projects from my second year group project, which scored a perfect mark of 100.  The current project should not be attempted by weaker students.",5,5,1,1,CHURCHILL
3,Running out of time,The projcet requrires the simulation to be working before movebase can be ported. If simulation is late due to unforseen difficulty then movebase might not be delivered.,TECHNICAL,MITIGATE,This is an inherent risk in the structure of the project. A lower-scoring project report could be submitted describing only the simulation aspects in the worst case.  Supervisor is knowledgable in the specifics of robotics research and may be able to assist to unblock technical problems to speed up simulation work if required.,3,3,2,2,CHURCHILL
